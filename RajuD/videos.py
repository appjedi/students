# Write a Python program that calculates the total cost of renting videos.  
# New videos cost $3 to rent, while oldies cost $2 to rent.  
# Your program will ask the user to enter the number of new videos that they rented, and also the number of oldies that they rented.  Then, your program should print out the total cost of renting videos. 

# When done, just submit your python source code file to this Dropbox.  Do not zip your file.
